# HowManyBirds
Phaser.io Game15

## Project Overview
The Bird Counting Game is a web-based game created using Phaser.io, an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript game framework. The game allows players to test their observation skills by counting the number of birds in an image within a limited time frame. It offers a simple and engaging user interface where players can start the game, attempt to count the birds, and receive a score based on their accuracy and speed.

## How it Works
- The game is built using Phaser.io, a framework that simplifies game development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The game starts by loading an image containing birds and displaying it to the player.
- A timer is set for 30 seconds to add a sense of urgency and challenge to the game.
- The player can input their guess for the number of birds they see.
- After the timer expires or the player submits their answer, the game reveals the correct number of birds in the image.
- If the player's guess matches the correct count, they earn 10 points. Otherwise, they receive no points for that round.
- The player can choose to pause, resume, or restart the game.
